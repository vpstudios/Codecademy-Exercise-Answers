##Learn Sass

Expand your CSS knowledge by learning SCSS syntax, nesting, functions, and more in this course on the Sass styling language.

Sass, or Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets, is an extension language for CSS. With Sass, you can write clean, sustainable CSS code and solve the common repetition and maintenance challenges present in traditional CSS.

In addition to being a valuable skill for any front-end developer, transitioning from CSS to Sass is pretty smooth due to the familiar syntax. For this reason, we will be learning the SCSS (Sassy CSS) syntax.

Sass can't be directly interpreted by your browser, so it must first be converted, or compiled, to CSS before the browser can directly understand it.

Compiling refers to converting code to lower level code so that it can be executed. By compiling SCSS to CSS, it can be interpreted by your browser and the results will appear on a webpage.
