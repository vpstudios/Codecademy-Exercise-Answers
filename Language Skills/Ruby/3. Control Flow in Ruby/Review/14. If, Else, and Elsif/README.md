##If

Ruby's if statement takes an expression, which is just a fancy word for something that has a value (like 4, true, or pants). If that expression is true, Ruby executes the block of code that follows the if. If it's not true (that is, false), Ruby doesn't execute that block of code: it skips it and goes on to the next thing.

##Else

The partner to the if statement is the else statement. An if/else statement says to Ruby: "If this expression is true, run this code block; otherwise, run the code after the else statement." Here's an example:

## Elseif

What if you want more than two options, though? It's elsif to the rescue! The elsif statement can add any number of alternatives to an if/else statement, like so:
