##If

Ruby's if statement takes an expression, which is just a fancy word for something that has a value (like 4, true, or pants). If that expression is true, Ruby executes the block of code that follows the if. If it's not true (that is, false), Ruby doesn't execute that block of code: it skips it and goes on to the next thing.
